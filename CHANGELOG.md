## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `pullmate init` interactive setup wizard: scans common directories for git repos, guides schedule and option configuration
- `pullmate doctor` health check: validates config, repo paths, remotes, OS scheduling entries, and log directory
- `pullmate add <path> [--group <name>]` command to add repos without editing JSON
- `pullmate remove <path>` command to remove repos without editing JSON
- `pullmate list` command to view all configured repositories and their groups
- `pullmate status [path]` command to check repo state (commits behind/ahead, dirty, diverged) without pulling
- `pullmate logs [--tail] [--errors] [-n <lines>]` command to view sync logs in the terminal
- `pullmate schedule list/add/remove` commands to manage schedules without editing JSON
- `--group <name>` flag on the default pull command to sync only a subset of repos
- Repository groups: repos can be tagged with `{ path, group }` in config
- Pre/post pull hooks: `options.hooks.beforePull` and `options.hooks.afterPull` (also per-repo)
- Improved dirty repo messaging: skipped repos now show "stash or commit to sync" hint

### Changed
- CLI refactored to use `commander` for proper subcommand and flag parsing
- `--help` and `--version` flags now handled by commander (`-h`, `-v`)
- `pullRepo` now accepts an optional `{ hooks }` argument
- `saveConfig` is now silent by default for internal calls
- `initConfig` no longer prints a warning when config already exists

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Core config management helpers: `getRepoPath`, `getRepoGroup`, `addRepo`, `removeRepo`, `addSchedule`, `removeSchedule`
- `getRepoStatus` for read-only repo inspection without pulling
- Hook execution support in `pullRepo` (`beforePull`, `afterPull`)

### Changed
- `runGitCommand` now uses `stdio: 'pipe'` to suppress git stderr noise
- Dirty repo status message updated to include actionable hint

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-18

### 🚀 Major Features
- ✨ **All-branch synchronization**: Now updates ALL local branches with their remote counterparts, not just the current branch
- 🎯 **Smart status detection**: Accurate "updated" vs "up-to-date" reporting based on actual commit changes
- 🧠 **Intelligent commit comparison**: Prevents false "updated" reports by comparing commit hashes before updating
- 📊 **Enhanced branch reporting**: Shows detailed summary of which other branches were updated, diverged, or failed

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
- 🔧 **Fixed false update detection**: No more misleading "updated" status when nothing actually changed
- 📢 **Corrected fetch messages**: Shows "Updates fetched from remote" only when branches actually received updates
- ⚡ **Eliminated redundant operations**: Prevents unnecessary git operations on already up-to-date branches
- 🎯 **Accurate status tracking**: Fixed logic that incorrectly marked repos as updated on consecutive runs

### 💅 UI/UX Improvements
- 🖥️ **Clean CLI output**: Streamlined console display with better formatting and spacing
- 📝 **Informative branch summaries**: Shows "X updated, Y up-to-date" for other branches
- 🔇 **Reduced log noise**: Moved verbose logging to files, keeping console output clean and focused
- 🎨 **Better status indicators**: Clear visual distinction between different repository states

### 🏗️ Technical Improvements
- 🔍 **Enhanced git operations**: Better error handling and edge case management for diverged branches
- 📈 **Improved performance**: More efficient branch checking with early exit conditions
- 🛡️ **Safer updates**: Additional safety checks before updating branch references
- 📋 **Better data structures**: Enhanced branch update tracking with detailed status information

### 🎁 What This Means For You
- **No more stale branches**: When you switch to `master` or any other branch, it's already up-to-date!
- **Truthful reporting**: You'll know exactly what was actually updated vs what was already current
